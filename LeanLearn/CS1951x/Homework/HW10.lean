/- # LoVe Homework 8 (10 bonus points): Metaprogramming

**This homework is optional!** You do not need to submit anything.
If you do, it will be counted for bonus points.

This homework mainly builds on the 10th lab.
If you are interested in getting a quick feel for metaprogramming,
we strongly recommend the lab *instead* of this homework.

Homework must be done in accordance with the course policies on collaboration
and academic integrity.

Replace the placeholders (e.g., `:= sorry`) with your solutions. When you are
finished, submit *only* this file to the appropriate Gradescope assignment.

This homework is not autograded.

/- ## Question 1 (10 points): A `safe` Tactic

You will develop a tactic that applies all safe introduction and elimination
rules for the connectives and quantifiers exhaustively. A rule is said to be
__safe__ if, given a provable goal, it always gives rise to provable subgoals.
In addition, we will require that safe rules do not introduce metavariables
(since these can easily be instantiated accidentally with the wrong terms).

You will proceed in three steps.

1.1 (4 points). Using a macro, develop a `safe_intros` tactic that repeatedly
applies the introduction rules for `True`, `∧`, and `↔` and that invokes
`intro _` for `→`/`∀`. The tactic generalizes `intro_and` from the lab. -/

    /- The proof state should be roughly as follows:

        case left
        a b c d : Prop
        a_1 : a
        a_2 : b
        ⊢ False

        case right.mp
        a b c d : Prop
        a_1 : a
        a_2 : c
        ⊢ d

        case right.mpr
        a b c d : Prop
        a_1 : a
        a_2 : d
        ⊢ c -/
    repeat sorry

/- 1.2 (4 points). Develop a `safe_cases` tactic that performs case
distinctions on `False`, `∧` (`And`), and `∃` (`Exists`). The tactic generalizes
`cases_and` from the exercise.

Hints:

* The last argument of `Expr.isAppOfArity` is the number of arguments expected
  by the logical symbol. For example, the arity of `∧` is 2.

* The "or" connective on `Bool` is called `||`. -/

/- 1.3 (2 points). Implement a `safe` tactic that first invokes `safe_intros`
on all goals, then `safe_cases` on all emerging subgoals, before it tries
`assumption` on all emerging subsubgoals. -/
